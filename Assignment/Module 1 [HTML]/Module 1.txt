           <html>

Question 9 :- How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?
Answer :- Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.
          For ex. <table cellpadding="value" >.....</table>
          where, value determines the padding 
          (space between the border of a table and its content)

          Cellspacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.
          For ex. <table cellspacing="value" >.....</table>
          where, value determines the padding 
          (space between adjacent cells)

Question 10 :- How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?
Answer :- It can be done by using the rowspan and colspan attribute in HTML.  The rowspan is used to merge or combine the number of cells in a row whereas the colspan is used to merge column cells in a table.  
          Example 1: In this example, we will merge two table row and make a single row.
          <html>
          <head>
               <title>.............</title>
          </head>
          <body>
               <table>
                  <tr>
                     <th>Name</th>
                     <th>Age</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td>Meet</td>
                     <td rowspan="2">24</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td>Prem</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
          </body>
          </html>

          In this example, we will merge two table column and make a single column.
          <html>
          <head>
               <title>.............</title>
          </head>
          <body>
               <table>
                  <tr>
                     <th>Name</th>
                     <th>Marks</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td>Meet</td>
                     <td>18</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td>Prem</td>
                     <td>18</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td colspan="2">Sum=36</td>
                </table>
          </body>
          </html>

Question 11 :- What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?
Answer :- Block-level Elements
          A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
          A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
          Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
          The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
          The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

        Inline Elements
        An inline element does not start on a new line.
        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
        <span> is used as inline element.

Question 12 :- How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? 
Answer :- HTML links are hyperlinks.
          You can click on a link and jump to another document.
          When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
          The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
          The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
          The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
          Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

Question 13 :- What is the use of an iframe tag? 
Answer :- The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
          An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
          iframe is a replacement of a <frame> and <frameset> which is removed in html5.
          iframe is mostly used for a place map in webpage.
          For Ex. <iframe src="Textformatting Practice.html" frameborder="20" height="300px" width="700px"></iframe>

Question 14 :- What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example? 
Answer :- In HTML, the span tag is a generic inline container element. Span tags usually wrap sections of text for styling purposes or for adding attributes to a section of text without creating a new line of content.
          The span element is called “generic” because the name of the tag itself doesn’t tell us anything about the contents of the element. In other words, “span” doesn’t mean anything to us. The opposite of a generic HTML element is a semantic HTML element, one whose name describes its purpose (e.g., <p> for paragraph, <button>, and <form>).

          Span tags are also “inline” elements, meaning that the element stays on the current line and does not create a line break.
          For ex. <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
          in this example you can see we want a specific text color that's why we use span tag.. if we use div tag then whole blue container will we blue.

Question 15 :- How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?
Answer :- In the body tag, specify a background image in the background attribute by passing the URL of the image or location path.
          For ex. In this example, we will be going to add the background image using the above approach.
                  <html>
                  <head>
                    <title>Website</title>
                  </head>
                  <body Backround="Images/img1">
                     <p>Hello World</p> 
                  </body>
                  </html>

          Backround image also insert by css.

Question 16 :- How are active links different from normal links? 
Answer :- Websites are designed to point you to different resources. You can move from one website to another through links. Links help you to get information from different resources. Links are established in simple HTML web pages through <a> tag.
          Links are categorized into three types. Typically a Link is displayed in three different colors based on the usage.
          1)Normal Links
          2)Visited Links
          3)Active Links

          Example 1: The following example shows the basic example for Normal Link ( Unvisited Link ). If you want to create a link to go to “https://www.google.com“,
                     <html>
                     <head>
                        <title>.......</title>
                     </head>
                     <body>
                        <h2>Hello World</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://www.google.com">Click Me</a>
                     </body>
                     </html>

          Visited Link: In example 1, If you click on the link shown above and again go back to the link page, you can now see the link is in purple color and underlined. It shows that the user has visited this link before.

          Active Link: In example 1, If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. Active Links shows that the browser is in the process to load a new resource. 

Question 17 :- What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

          <br> tag – Usually <br> tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line
          <p> tag – This contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.
          <blockquote> tag – It is used to define a large quoted section. If you have a large quotation, then put the entire text within <blockquote>……….</blockquote> tag.

          SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
          SVG defines the graphics in XML format
          Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated
          SVG is a W3C recommendation
          SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL
