Answer :- embed audio in HTML
          To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.
          For ex.
          <audio>
             <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
          </audio>

          For Ex.
          <video>
             <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
          </video>

Question 3 :- Semantic element in HTML5?
Answer :- A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
          Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
          Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

          In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: 
          <article>
          <aside>
          <details>
          <figcaption>
          <figure>
          <footer>
          <header>
          <main>
          <mark>
          <nav>
          <section>
          <summary>
          <time>

Question 4 :- Canvas and SVG tags
Answer :- SVG
          SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

          An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc

          canvas
          The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
